## Project Highlight
[NosLib](https://github.com/Noscka/NosLib) – [C++] NosLib is a library created and managed to increase productivity and throughput. The library contains frequently used functions, my subprojects (such as ConsoleMenu, DynamicArray, etc), and compatibility between said subprojects.</br></br>

[Project LVATT](https://github.com/EastEuropean-Tech/Project-LVATT) – [C++] LVATT utilizes Digital signal processing and whisper AI model. The program takes in a complex signal (IQ File), the demodulates the signal to extract the audio, It both writes the audio to file and then passes it on to the AI model (straight from memory), The AI model transribes and translates the received audio. This is a team project, and for this project we had to learn an unreal amount of new concepts and theories.</br></br>

[NosNet](https://github.com/Noscka/NosNet) – [C++] This project uses what I’ve learned from the C++ Networking project (the one below) to create a User/Client lead communications system. NosNet allows for direct communication between the clients without a middleman server, this allows for quicker communication, file sharing with no limit, and an unseen amount of privacy.</br></br>

[C++ Networking](https://github.com/Noscka/Cpp-Networking) – [C++] A project utilizing the boost library plus NosLib (The one above) to create file transfer program. The program is designed to use minimal memory, allow for download resumes. This project was mostly made to learn how to use Boost ASIO and to develop.</br></br>

[NCGI](https://github.com/Noscka/Norzkas-Custom-Gamma-Installer) - [C++] A custom alternative installer for a modpack called “G.A.M.M.A.” for a game called “Stalker Anomaly”. Designed with ease of use in mind, and made to be lightweight. The installer achieves quick download speeds and makes the final installation have smaller final size compared to the official installer.</br></br>

[Unreal Realism](https://github.com/Noscka/Unreal-Realism-Test) – [Unreal Engine C++] Unreal Realism is a game project meant to create a foundation which is easily expandable and could later be build on. So, the end goal of this game won’t have any story, goal, or anything alike but will only be a demonstration and a foundation of what I was able to create in the field of combat realism.</br></br>
